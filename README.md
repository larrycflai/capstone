## Capstone Project: AI-Powered Learning Intervention for Secondary Maths

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Larry Lai!

I'm a dedicated **Secondary Maths Educator** with a keen interest in **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**. My background in teaching has honed my problem-solving and analytical skills, which I'm now channelling into the world of data and AI. I'm currently deepening my expertise through an ML/AI certification from Imperial College London, focusing on practical applications and understanding how these technologies can revolutionise education. My prior experience in **IT infrastructure** and **cloud storage** also provides a solid technical foundation.

## Project Summary

This capstone project aims to develop an AI-powered tool designed to identify students in secondary mathematics education who could benefit from **scaffolding intervention** and **personalised support**. By leveraging machine learning, this tool seeks to provide early indicators for educators, enabling timely and targeted strategies to enhance student learning outcomes and engagement.

## Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

1.  To build a machine learning model capable of identifying students in secondary maths for whom **specific scaffolding interventions or supplemental learning opportunities** are recommended, based on their engagement in standard learning activities and historical data.
2.  To demonstrate the feasibility of using synthetic (or publicly available, where appropriate) educational data to train and evaluate such a model, ensuring privacy considerations are respected.
3.  To lay the groundwork for a data-driven approach that supports educators in making informed decisions about differentiated instruction and personalised learning pathways.

## Problem Statement

Traditional methods of identifying students who might benefit from additional support, such as voluntary "Maths Clinics," can often be **reactive, time-consuming for educators, and inefficient in resource allocation due to fluctuating attendance.** Furthermore, without clear, data-driven justifications, student and parental engagement with these crucial extra-curricular interventions can be suboptimal, often only driven by the looming pressure of examinations like GCSEs.

## Key Tools and Libraries (Initial Phase)

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
* **Machine Learning Frameworks:** (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch - *choose based on what you plan to use*)
* **Data Manipulation:** (e.g., pandas, NumPy)
* **Data Visualisation:** (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Version Control:** Git
* **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks (for initial exploration and prototyping)
