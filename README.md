### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Larry Lai!

I'm a dedicated **Secondary Maths Educator** with a keen interest in **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**. My background in teaching has honed my problem-solving and analytical skills, which I'm now channelling into the world of data and AI.

ðŸš€ Currently, I'm deepening my expertise through an ML/AI certification, focusing on practical applications and understanding how these technologies can revolutionise education. My prior experience in **IT infrastructure** and **cloud storage** also provides a solid technical foundation.

ðŸ’¡ I'm particularly fascinated by the potential of AI to:
- Personalise learning pathways for pupils.
- Optimise educational strategies and resource allocation.
- Enhance data-driven decision-making in the classroom and beyond.

ðŸ’» Outside of teaching, I enjoy building websites with WordPress, further broadening my technical toolkit.

ðŸŒ± **Learning Goals**: Building robust ML models, exploring ethical AI in education, and contributing to innovative ed-tech solutions.
